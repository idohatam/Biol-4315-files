\description{
This function checks for the presence of required R packages
and installs any that are missing. It ensures all necessary packages for
the course are available in the R environment.
}
\details{
The function uses a predefined list of required packages. It compares
this list against the installed packages in the R environment. Missing packages
are installed via \code{install.packages}. If a package installation fails, the
failure is logged in the returned report, but the function continues attempting
to install the remaining packages. The package does not reinstall or update packages that are already installed.
