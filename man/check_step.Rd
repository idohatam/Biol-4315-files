A helper function to check if a specific setup step has been completed successfully.
}
\details{
This function takes a step name and checks if it has been executed successfully. It is typically used
in the setup workflow to ensure that critical steps (e.g., installing Conda, setting up channels, etc.)
have completed without errors. If the step has not been completed, it returns a failure message;
otherwise, it confirms that the step is successful.
