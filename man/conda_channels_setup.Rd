\title{Configure Conda Channels}
\usage{
conda_channels_setup()
}
\value{
A character vector containing the status of each step, including
whether channels were added or if they were already configured, and
whether the channel priority was successfully set to \code{strict}.
}
\description{
This function ensures that the required Conda channels
(\code{defaults}, \code{conda-forge}, and \code{bioconda}) are properly configured
and sets the channel priority to \code{strict}.
}
\details{
The function checks if the required Conda channels are already
configured in the user's environment. If a channel is missing, it is added
to the configuration. Additionally, the function verifies that the
channel priority is set to \code{strict} for reliable package resolution.
A status report is returned to indicate the success or failure of each step.

Note that this function is an internal helper function used by the wrapper function.
Therefore it assumes Conda is already installed and available in the system's PATH.
Any errors during channel configuration will be captured and reported in the status report.
