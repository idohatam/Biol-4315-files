\title{Verify and Install Third-Party Tools via Conda}
\usage{
conda_check_tools()
}
\value{
A character vector containing the status of each tool's
installation. It indicates whether a tool was already installed or
successfully installed. Errors during installation are also reported.
}
\description{
This function checks whether the required third-party tools
are installed in the Conda environment. If any tools are missing, it
installs them using Conda.
}
\details{
The function iterates through a predefined list of tools required
for the workflow. For each tool, it checks its availability using the
\verb{conda list} command. If a tool is missing, it attempts to install it
via \verb{conda install}. The function captures the status of each tool's
installation and returns a detailed report.

Errors encountered during the installation of specific tools are logged
in the report, but the function continues checking and installing the
remaining tools.

Note that this is an internal helper function called by the wrapper function.
Therefore, it assumes that Conda is installed and the required channels (e.g., Bioconda) are properly configured.
If these prerequisites are not met, tool installation will fail.
