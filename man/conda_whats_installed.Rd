\title{Conda Workflow Setup}
\usage{
conda_whats_installed()
}
\value{
A list summarizing the status of each step in the setup workflow.
Each entry in the list contains a status message indicating success or failure.
}
\description{
This wrapper function orchestrates the entire setup workflow for your project.
It downloads and installs Miniconda (if needed), configures Conda channels, updates Conda packages,
installs third-party tools, and installs required R packages.
Note that this will only work on Mac computers with Intel silicone
}
\details{
If any critical step fails (e.g., Conda installation or channel setup),
the function will terminate and print the corresponding error message.
Non-critical failures (such as failed R package installations) will trigger warnings,
but the workflow will continue. Note that the function does not take any arguments and
internally runs a series of helper functions to complete the setup process.
}
\examples{
{
  # Run the full setup workflow
  report <- conda_whats_installed()
  print(report)
